<h1>Johnson's Algorithm on GPU</h1>

We present a parallel implementation of Johnsonâ€™s algorithm, which solves APSP problem on recent GPU architecture. <br>
Proposed algorithmic and architectural optimizations results in more than 4.5 times speed up of all-pairs shortest path calculation for large graphs with respect to the CPU. <br>
In this repo, source code, including parallel and sequential implementations, and sample graphs are provided.
